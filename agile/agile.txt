## Exploitation Steps

**Curl and Initial Analysis**

Use `curl -i IP` to display the headers, including the redirect.

**Local File Inclusion (LFI) Analysis**

Analyze the various requests made on the site with Burp.
Send a GET request: `GET /download?fn=../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1` where LFI is present. 
Requesting a non-existent file triggers an error and provides information on accessing a console protected by a PIN.

**Getting PIN using Werkzeug**

Refer to [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/werkzeug) for instructions on how to crack Werkzeug and obtain the PIN.

**Obtaining Reverse Shell**

Utilize `os.system` command to start a reverse shell.

**Exploring Configuration Files**

Investigate configuration files with `cd ..`.

**MySQL Access and Getting Password**

Access MySQL and inspect the DB to retrieve the password for "corum": `5db7caa1d13cc37c9fc2`.

**SSH Access**

Log in via SSH.

## Advanced Investigation

**Using pspy to Monitor Processes**

Download and use `pspy` to examine processes. 
Among them there is a Chrome instance with remote debugging enabled.

**Remote Debugging in Chrome**

Learn about [Chrome Remote Debugging](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/debugging/remote_debugger) and [this guide](https://arnab-k.medium.com/chrome-remote-debugging-7933a6f6d44d).

**Exploit Remote Debugging**

Connected to remote debugging, an instance of "superpass" is logged in as "edwards". Access the vault and retrieve its password: `d07867c6267dcb5df0af`.

**Logging in as Edwards**

SSH log in as "edwards".

## Privilege Escalation

**Sudo Version Vulnerability**

Check `sudo` version, which is vulnerable to CVE. Details in this [CVE report](https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/sudo-CVE-2023-22809.pdf).

**Exploiting Sudo Vulnerability**

Run `EDITOR='vim -- /app/venv/bin/activate' sudo -u dev_admin sudoedit /app/config_test.json`. 
Append `chmod u+s /bin/bash` in the end of the file.
Launch `/bin/bash -p`. This executes the executable with real SUID and GUID (useful for binaries with SUID).
